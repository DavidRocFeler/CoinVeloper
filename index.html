            <h2>BITCOIN</h2>

            <h3>THE FATHER OF CRYPTOS</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>What is BITCOIN?</li>
               </ul>
                  <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency, meaning it is not controlled by any government
                      or centralized institution. It was created in 2008 by an individual or group of 
                      individuals under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The main objective of Bitcoin was 
                      to create a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that would allow direct transactions 
                      between users without the need for intermediaries such as banks or payment processing 
                      companies.</p>

                  <li>Beginning of the bitcoin (BTC)</li>
               </ul>
                  <p>The birth of Bitcoin dates back to the article published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." In this article, Nakamoto proposed the concept of a digital currency that would operate on a decentralized
                      network based on blockchain technology.</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Backing Technology</li>
               </ul>
                  <p>The technology backing Bitcoin is blockchain technology, which is a public ledger of all transactions made with Bitcoin. The Bitcoin blockchain is decentralized and distributed across nodes in the network, meaning it is not controlled by a single entity and cannot 
                      be easily altered. This ensures transparency and security of transactions on the Bitcoin network.</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Bitcoin Objective</li>
                </ul>
                  <p>Satoshi Nakamoto's goal in creating Bitcoin was to provide an electronic payment
                     system that was independent of any centralized institution, such as banks or
                     governments. Nakamoto wanted to create a system that would allow people to transact 
                     directly with each other without the need for intermediaries, with low fees and no                
                     geographical restrictions. Additionally, the limitation of Bitcoin's supply to 21 million units              
                     was proposed to prevent inflation and provide scarcity, potentially increasing its value              
                     over time.

         <h2>ETHEREUM</h2>
         <h3>THE FIRST DESCENTRALIZED PLATAFORM</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>What is ETHEREUM?</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform and cryptocurrency that enables
             the creation and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). 
             It was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and cryptocurrency researcher, 
             and went live on July 30, 2015.

         <h2>THETER</h2>
         <h3>THE CRYPTOCURRENCY THAT DOES NOT FLUCTUATE</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>What is THETER?</li>
         </ul>
         <p>USDT, or Tether, is a cryptocurrency known as a "stablecoin," designed to maintain a 
            stable value relative to a fiat currency, typically the US dollar. It is a digital token 
            whose value is backed by a reserve of fiat currency in a 1:1 ratio. 
            USDT works as a digital token that utilizes blockchain technology to record and validate 
            transactions. Each unit of USDT in circulation is backed by an equivalent amount of fiat currency,
             held in a bank account or other reserve. This ensures that the value of USDT remains stable 
             and is linked to the value of the underlying fiat currency.
