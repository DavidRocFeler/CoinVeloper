                        <h4>THE CRYPTOCURRENCY THAT DOES NOT FLUCTUATE, WHAT IS THETER?</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">USDT, or Tether, is a cryptocurrency known as a "stablecoin," 
                            designed to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency, 
                            typically the US dollar. It is a digital token whose value is backed by a 
                            reserve of fiat currency in a 1:1 ratio. 
                            USDT works as a digital token that utilizes blockchain technology to record 
                            and validate transactions. Each unit of USDT in circulation is backed by an 
                            equivalent amount of fiat currency, held in a bank account or other reserve. 
                            This ensures that the value of USDT remains stable and is linked to the value 
                            of the underlying fiat currency.
                            </p>

                        <h4>BEGINNING OF THE THETER?(USDT)</h4>                    
                        <p class="paragraph">was launched in 2014 under the name "Realcoin" and was later 
                            rebranded as Tether. The idea behind its creation was to provide an alternative 
                            to volatile cryptocurrencies by offering a digital asset whose value was stably 
                            linked to a fiat currency.
                            The founders of Tether are Brock Pierce, Craig Sellars, and Reeve Collins, who 
                            launched the cryptocurrency through the company Tether Limited. However, there 
                            is some controversy regarding the true identity and transparency of the founders.

                        <h4>BACKING TECHNOLOGY</h4>                 
                        <p class="paragraph">The technology backing USDT is blockchain. This stablecoin
                             operates on various blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, and others. 
                             Through these blockchains, USDT tokens are issued and tracked.

                        <h4>THETER OBJETIVE</h4>                     
                        <p class="paragraph">The main objective of the creator of USDT was to provide a form 
                            of digital transaction that was backed by a stable fiat currency, such as the US 
                            dollar. This would allow users to move funds more efficiently in and out of the
                             cryptocurrency ecosystem, without being affected by the price volatility typical 
                             of many other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, USDT is used as a trading tool and 
                             store of value within the cryptocurrency market, enabling traders and investors 
                             to mitigate the risk of exposure to market volatility.
