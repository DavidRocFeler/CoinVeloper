                        <h4>ADA Whale Activity Sparks Speculation: Is a Short-Term Rebound in Sight?</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">Cardano whales continue to accumulate altcoins despite a 30% drop in 
                            its value over the past month.
                            A blockchain data provider indicated in a post on X that "over the last week, ADA has 
                            seen an average daily of $13.84 billion in large transactions."</p>

                        <p class="paragraph"> According to the user, this represents a third of Bitcoin's (BTC) 
                            current volume, five times more than Litecoin (LTC) volume, and over 16 times that 
                            of the leading meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE).
                            On the other hand, data observed that the coin witnessed an increase in its daily
                             count of whale transactions exceeding $100,000 this Monday, April 29, when these
                              transactions totaled 1,776, the highest daily count for the coin since November 
                              8, 2023.</p>
                            
                        <p class="paragraph">According to the data provider, "these peaks in whale activity 
                            historically correlate with potential price reversals." But now the question is,
                             is ADA poised for a short-term rebound?</p>

                        <h4>Renewed Activity Sparks Speculation</h4>                    
                        <p class="paragraph">An assessment of its performance on a 1-day chart showed that the 
                            coin's price positioned below its 20 and 50-day moving averages (MA).
                            These MAs typically serve as support levels. Therefore, when an asset's price falls 
                            to these levels, it usually suggests a temporary pause in the price decline as buyers 
                            step in.</p>

                            
                        <p class="paragraph">However, if the price falls below these MAs with strong selling volume, it could 
                            confirm the bearish trend signal.
                            ADA's price trended below these MAs on April 1. The decrease in its Relative Strength 
                            Index (RSI) indicator confirmed the subsequent increase in selling pressure on the coin 
                            since then.</p>
                            
                  
                            
                        <p class="paragraph">ADA's RSI is 35.67 at the time of this publication, suggesting that the coin would soon 
                            be oversold if the selling momentum persisted. Since its price fell below the MAs on 
                            April 1, ADA's price dropped by double digits, as observed by CoinMarketCap.</p>
