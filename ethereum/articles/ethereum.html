                        <h4>WHAT IS ETHEREUM?, THE FIRST DESCENTRALIZED PLATAFORM</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform and cryptocurrency that enables
                            the creation and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). 
                            It was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and cryptocurrency researcher, 
                            and went live on July 30, 2015.</p>

                        <h4>BEGINNING OF THE ETHEREUM (ETH)</h4>                    
                        <p class="paragraph">Vitalik Buterin is the creator of Ethereum. He envisioned 
                            Ethereum as a platform that would enable developers to create decentralized 
                            applications and smart contracts, providing them with greater flexibility and 
                            functionality compared to existing blockchain platforms like Bitcoin.
                            Ethereum was born out of the desire to extend the capabilities of blockchain 
                            beyond simple peer-to-peer transactions, allowing developers to build 
                            decentralized applications and smart contracts. These smart contracts 
                            are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly 
                            written into code. They automatically enforce and execute the terms of the 
                            agreement when predefined conditions are met, eliminating the need for 
                            intermediaries in many contractual agreements.
                            </p>

                        <h4>BACKING TECHNOLOGY</h4>                 
                        <p class="paragraph">The technology that underpins Ethereum is similar to that of 
                            Bitcoin, utilizing a decentralized network of nodes to validate and record 
                            transactions. However, Ethereum's blockchain is more versatile, featuring a 
                            Turing-complete programming language that allows developers to build a wide 
                            range of applications and execute complex smart contracts. 
                            be easily altered. This ensures transparency and security of transactions on
                            the Bitcoin network.</p>

                        <h4>ETHEREUM OBJETIVE</h4>                     
                        <p class="paragraph">The objective of Vitalik Buterin in creating Ethereum was to 
                            democratize and decentralize the internet by providing a platform for building 
                            decentralized applications and smart contracts. He aimed to empower developers 
                            to create applications that are censorship-resistant, tamper-proof, and run 
                            without the need for intermediaries, ultimately fostering innovation and creating 
                            new possibilities for decentralized finance, governance, and more.
