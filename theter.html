                <p>USDT, or Tether, is a cryptocurrency known as a "stablecoin," designed to maintain a 
                    stable value relative to a fiat currency, typically the US dollar. It is a digital token 
                    whose value is backed by a reserve of fiat currency in a 1:1 ratio. 
                    USDT works as a digital token that utilizes blockchain technology to record and validate 
                    transactions. Each unit of USDT in circulation is backed by an equivalent amount of fiat currency,
                     held in a bank account or other reserve. This ensures that the value of USDT remains stable 
                     and is linked to the value of the underlying fiat currency.</p>
