                        <h4 class="subtitle">WHAT IS BITCOIN?</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency, meaning it is not controlled by any government
                            or centralized institution. It was created in 2008 by an individual or group of 
                            individuals under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The main objective of Bitcoin was 
                            to create a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that would allow direct transactions 
                            between users without the need for intermediaries such as banks or payment processing 
                            companies.</p>

                        <h4 class="subtitle">BEGINNING OF THE BITCOIN (BTC)</h4>                    
                        <p class="paragraph">The birth of Bitcoin dates back to the article published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." In this article, Nakamoto proposed the concept of a digital currency that would operate on a decentralized
                            network based on blockchain technology.</p>

                        <h4 class="subtitle">BACKING TECHNOLOGY</h4>                 
                        <p class="paragraph">The technology backing Bitcoin is blockchain technology, which is a public ledger of all transactions made with Bitcoin. The Bitcoin blockchain is decentralized and distributed across nodes in the network, meaning it is not controlled by a single entity and cannot 
                            be easily altered. This ensures transparency and security of transactions on the Bitcoin network.</p>

                        <h4 class="subtitle">BITCOIN OBJETIVE</h4>                     
                        <p class="paragraph">Satoshi Nakamoto's goal in creating Bitcoin was to provide an electronic payment
                           system that was independent of any centralized institution, such as banks or
                           governments. Nakamoto wanted to create a system that would allow people to transact 
                           directly with each other without the need for intermediaries, with low fees and no                
                           geographical restrictions. Additionally, the limitation of Bitcoin's supply to 21 million units              
                           was proposed to prevent inflation and provide scarcity, potentially increasing its value              
                           over time.
