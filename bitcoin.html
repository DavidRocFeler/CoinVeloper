            <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency, meaning it is not controlled by any government
                or centralized institution. It was created in 2008 by an individual or group of 
                individuals under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The main objective of Bitcoin was 
                to create a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that would allow direct transactions 
                between users without the need for intermediaries such as banks or payment processing 
                companies.</p>
