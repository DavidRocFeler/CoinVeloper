        <h3>About</h3>

        <div class="secondBlock">
    
        <p>Chorus One is one of the leading operators of infrastructure for Proof-of-Stake networks and 
            decentralized protocols. Tens of thousands of retail customers and institutions are staking 
            billions in assets through our infrastructure helping to secure protocols and earn rewards.
             Our mission is to increase freedom and speed of innovation through decentralized technologies.</p>

        <p>We are a diverse team of 60+ people distributed all over the globe. We value radical transparency, 
            striving for excellence and improvement while treating each other with kindness and generosity. 
            If this sounds like you, we’d love to hear from you.</p>
        </div>

        <h5>Role</h5>

        <div class="secondBlock">
            <p>As a Senior Software Engineer, you will be an integral part of our Ethereum software engineering 
                team focusing on automation of validator infrastructure and building great staking products. 
                OPUS is our product suite which offers a one-stop-shop product for staking Ethereum. For users, 
                it offers a portal where users can stake and see their rewards, and check the status of their 
                validators. On the backend, we have a platform that automatically launches, manages, and monitors 
                these validators.</p>

            <p>OPUS consists of a React/Next.js frontend and a backend written in Rust. It is backed by PostgreSQL 
                and Hashicorp Vault, and runs mostly on Google Cloud, with some bandwidth-intensive parts running 
                on bare metal.</p>
                
            <p>Your main role will be to design, develop, and deploy software systems to advance our product as
                 well as other staking services.</p>
